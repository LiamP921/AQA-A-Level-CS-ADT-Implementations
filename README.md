# AQA A-Level CS ADT Implementations
OO Python implementations of all ADTs included in the AQA A-Level CS Specification!

These are:

- Linear Queue

- Circular Queue

- Priority Queue (utilising a heap to maintain logical element order via heap rules)

- Stack

- Graph (utilising an adjacency list for either directed or undirected graphs, w/ depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods, as well as Dijsktra's algorithm)

- Binary Search Tree (w/ in, pre, and post-order traversal methods; balancing method TBA)

- Vector (w/ Graham Scan to compute the convex hull created by a list of instances. This can then be displayed via matplotlib functions)
